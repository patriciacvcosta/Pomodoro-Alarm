## Description

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals (traditionally 25 minutes in length) separated by short breaks (traditionally 5 minutes).

The FocusTimer App lets you configure a Focus and a Break time, with a maximum duration of 1 hour each. That way, you can prepare yourself psychologically to have a more focused work session, knowing that you'll also get to take regular breaks. This will bolster your motivation and keep you creative to complete a task within a set period of time.

Transform time from being an enemy to being an ally.
